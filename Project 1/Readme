go to stdlinux and type subscribe to make sure you're running python-3
    if not:
        1) open a terminal
        2) type "subscribe"
        3) subscribe to #17 (python-3)

HOW TO RUN THE IM PLATFORM
 1) open a terminal
 2) change directorys to the Project 1 folder (whereever you extracted the project)
 3) type python3 to make sure you have python3. type quit() to exit
 4) in the same terminal where the "server.py" file is, type:
        python3 server.py
 5) in another terminal, change directory to where the "client.py" file exists (should be same as before)
 6) in this terminal type:
        python3 client.py
*note* for each additional client you'd like to run, repeat steps 5 and 6 per client


SERVER
- nothing needs to be typed here
- the server display any new connections (ip and port)
    - if the client logs in, the server will also display the username in addition to ip and port
- the server will also show the commmand issued by the client. Valid commmands are:
    1) Register <username> <password>
    2) Login <username> <password>
    3) List (this will list all the active users on the server)
    4) Message <username> <msg> (the user must be active)
    5) Logout <username>
        - chose to not allow a user to log another user out since this wouldn't make sense
        - thus, <username> must be the username of the currently logged in client


client
- can issue commands specified by the server
